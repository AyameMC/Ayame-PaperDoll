# Extra Player Renderer

Render a player entity on the bottom left corner of he screen.

The Chat HUD will be moved upward, so that it won't be blocked.

This mod is not fully developed, so it's released under license CC0-1.0, free free to modify.

This mod **requires malilib and Fabric API** (not Fabric loader, they are separate things), you should also install it.

This mod is compatible with Gamepiaynmo's [CustomPlayerModel](https://github.com/Gamepiaynmo/CustomModel) mod, but the compatibility is not ensured if you use models smaller or larger than a normal player model.

## Configurations
While holding key `F8` in default:
- Press `up/down/left/right` arrows to move the rendered player around.
- Press `M` to flip(mirror) the player.
- Press `-` or `=` to scale player. (not the numpad keys!)

Plus, you can see some extra settings in `.minecraft/config/explayerenderer.json`. They allow you to control light directions, hand swing and even more details!
