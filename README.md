This mod is not fully developed, so it's released under license CC0-1.0, free free to modify.

This mod **requires malilib and Fabric API** (not Fabric loader, they are separate things), you should also install it.

This mod is compatible with Gamepiaynmo's [CustomPlayerModel](https://github.com/Gamepiaynmo/CustomModel) mod, but the compatibility is not ensured if you use models smaller or larger than a normal player model.
